collision
=========

Simulation code for the analysis of concurrent transmission in IEEE 802.15.4 wireless networks. 
This is the accompanying code to the technical report available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.4978.

Directories:
- src: Python code for calculating the demodulator output of the receiver
- figs: code used to generate some of the figures in the paper, this shows use cases of the simulation code
- collision-viz: re-implementation of the simulation code in JavaScript and the visualization applet code
